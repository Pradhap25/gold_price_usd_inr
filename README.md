📘 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the gold price trend in relation to the USD-INR exchange rate. The main objective is to study how currency value fluctuations impact gold prices over a specific period.

🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to understand the relationship between gold prices and foreign exchange rates, particularly USD to INR. The analysis helps in identifying patterns and predicting future price movements.

⚙️ Methodology

The analysis involves collecting financial data, cleaning and structuring it, and preparing it for visualization and modeling. The USD-INR data is extracted for a specific time frame and processed to ensure accurate interpretation.

📊 Process Description

Data Collection – Historical USD-INR exchange rate data is gathered from reliable online financial sources.

Data Cleaning – The dataset is organized, missing values are handled, and column names are standardized.

Data Analysis – The exchange rate trend is observed to understand the fluctuations over time.
